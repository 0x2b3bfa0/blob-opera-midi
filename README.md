# blob-opera-midi

## Installation

`$ npm install -g blob-opera-midi`

## Usage

Run with `blob-opera-midi song.mid`. Arrow keys to select parts to map, enter to bring up a dialog with a number input corresponding to MIDI tracks from track graph on right, click (yes, with your mouse) the export button, then `esc` or `q` to exit. Note that many SATB arrangements are already ordered correctly, so if the default looks correct you can just click export.
